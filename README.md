## Insight
The sales target was achieved by 85%, but there is room for improvement. Argentina led in sales ($953.3M), while Chile had the lowest ($253.6M).
Customer service quality could be improved - Speed (54%) & Service (53%) scored lowest, indicating a need for faster order processing and better customer service training.
Expand operations in high-growth markets (Argentina, Brazil, and Ecuador).
